= shipalert

shipalert reports whether a vessel is in currently within a specified
geographical bounding box.

shipalert obtains vessel positions by scraping the HTML from
https://www.vesselfinder.com[VesselFinder], which limits its reliability.
VesselFinder offers a subscription API for more serious applications.
